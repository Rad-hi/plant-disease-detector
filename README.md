# Plant disease detection model creation workshop

## Description

This folder aims at showcasing how one would go about creating a plant disease detection system. Specifically, it's made to guide *you* towards creating your own machine learning model that does the classification of the plant leafs, and how you would start to embed it into an application.

## Train the machine learning model, and obtain the dataset

For the dataset, model creation, and training, this tutorial have been followed: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/atharvaingle/plant-disease-classification-resnet-99-2](https://www.kaggle.com/code/atharvaingle/plant-disease-classification-resnet-99-2).
